# Nesting uses indentation. 2 space indent is preferred (but not required).
a_nested_map:
  key: value
  another_key: Another Value
  another_nested_map:
    hello: hello

# Maps don't have to have string keys.
0.25: a float key

# Keys can also be complex, like multi-line objects
# We use ? followed by a space to indicate the start of a complex key.

  This is a key
  that has multiple lines
: and this is its value

# YAML also allows mapping between sequences with the complex key syntax
# Some language parsers might complain
# An example
# ? - Manchester United
#   - Real Madrid
# : [2001-01-01, 2002-02-02]

? !!int 37
: THirtySeven

? !!python/tuple [5,7]

# Sequences (equivalent to lists or arrays) look like this
# (note that the '-' counts as indentation):
a_sequence:
  - Item 1
  - Item 2
  - 0.5  # sequences can contain disparate types.
  - Item 4
  - key: value
    another_key: another_value
  -
    - This is a sequence
    - inside another sequence
  - - - Nested sequence indicators
      - can be collapsed

# Since YAML is a superset of JSON, you can also write JSON-style maps and
# sequences:
json_map: {"key": "value"}
json_seq: [3, 2, 1, "takeoff"]
and quotes are optional: {key: [3, 2, 1, takeoff]}
